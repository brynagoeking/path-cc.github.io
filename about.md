The Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing (PATh) is a project funded by
NSF's OAC Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC\*) program in order to address the
needs of the rapidly growing community of faculty and students who are
embracing Distributed High Throughput Computing (dHTC) technologies and
services to advance their research. Across the science and engineering
community, a growing number of single-PI groups are joining the cohort of
international physical science collaborations who have depended on the dHTC
paradigm for decades.

PATh brings together two entities with a strong history of supporting
dHTC-enabled research: the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) and the
OSG Consortium. The team that founded CHTC at University of
Wisconsin–Madison pioneered, in the mid 1990s, the concept and principles of
HTC and has advanced and sustained the HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS) ever
since. Roughly in parallel and driven by the needs of physics researchers, a
diverse and multidisciplinary collaboration laid the foundation of the OSG in
the late 1990s to develop, deploy, operate, and sustain a shared and global
dHTC ecosystem of sites spanning geographic and administrative boundaries.

The partnership firmly believes in dHTC as an accessible computing paradigm
which supports the democratization of research computing to include researchers
and organizations otherwise underrepresented in the national CI ecosystem. Our
work is founded on universal principles like sharing, autonomy, unity of
purpose, and mutual trust. Our goal is to deliver adoption of technologies and
methodologies that is based on knowledge and understanding. Students, industry,
federal agencies, and the public are critical elements in achieving this goal
and in maximizing broad and long-term societal impact in areas like human
health, security, and national competitiveness. All areas of PATh are engaged
in a coordinated effort across campuses and science domains that couples CI
services and capabilities with the empowerment of a diverse workforce.

PATh’s distributed HTC approach strives to increase the national return on
investment of compute resources by enabling institutions to share computing
capacity, simultaneously maximizing utilization while also giving smaller
campuses easier access to this vital capacity. PATh is aligned with the NSF
National CI Coordination Services blueprint's goal of producing an "an agile,
integrated, robust, trustworthy and sustainable CI ecosystem that drives new
thinking and transformative discoveries in all areas of science and engineering
research and education." The techniques advanced by PATh serve the national
interest by promoting the progress of science, from academic research groups,
to large collaborations, institutions, and industry, with training and outreach
components designed and executed to empower the communities that can benefit
from these services.
