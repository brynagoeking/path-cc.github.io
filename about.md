The Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing (PATh) project is funded by the
NSF to advance High Throughput Computing (HTC) and its impact on research and 
education. To achieve this goal, PATh operates a fabric of capacity services 
that ranges from Research Computing Facilitation, to Access Points capable of 
managing distributed HTC workloads. Starting January 2022, PATh will add to its
fabric of services support for capacity credit accounts. These accounts will 
provide PIs with HTC workloads access to the processing and storage capacity of 
dedicated resources managed by PATh. NSF will deposit credit into these accounts 
when funding a proposal.

A team of PATh Facilitators is available to guide PIs in effectively using the 
Access Points to manage their HTC workloads and utilizing their credit; training
and documentation material are also available. Access Points provide a rich set 
of capabilities for managing workloads that consist of individual jobs, sets of
jobs, or Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) of jobs. Further, PIs can utilize access
points to perform data placement and data caching through the [Open Science Data
Federation](https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/data/stashcache/overview/).

The two PATh partners â€“ the [OSG Consortium](https://osg-htc.org) and the [UW-Madison Center for High
Throughput Computing (CHTC)](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/), have a long track record in turning the potential
of distributed HTC into scientific discovery in a broad range of domains.
Information about how research efforts, ranging from a single PI to international
collaboration, leveraged the power of our HTC services are documented in our
collection of [science stories](/news/htc-in-support-of-science/).
